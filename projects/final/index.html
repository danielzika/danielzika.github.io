      <p>If you opened your closet right now...you could probably estimate how much you spent on everything you see...but what is the real cost, the environmental cost of all this clothing?</p>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
 

       <p>In 1980...the average American bought 12 pairs of new clothing per year. Today...that number has skyrocketed...to close to 68 new pieces a year...which contributes to over 10% of our planet’s total CO2 emissions.</p>
        
      <p>The impact of all these wasted materials creates 1/5th of the world’s industrial water pollution and we as shoppers may be the only way to change the tides.</p>
        
      <p>The main cause of all this buying is a trend called Fast Fashion...lead by brands like Zara, H&M, Fashionova.</p>
        
        
      <p>Over the last 20 years...these brands have changed the entire clothing industry...creating the only sector to see large-scale growth. </p>
        
      <p>Cotton products are some of the most popular all over the globe...but almost 90% of all cotton is produced with high amounts of toxic chemicals.</p>
      
      <p>Pollutant materials, like cotton dyed with toxic chemicals and crude oil-based athletic-wear are becoming cheaper and cheaper. </p>
        
    <p>In other sectors of the clothing industry...brands like Patagonia and The North Face have become staples for championing regenerative ways to manufacture clothing.</p> 
        
      <p>Some brands like Patagonia and North Face pay high premiums for organic materials...but in return have to charge more...often 5-10 times the price for the same item. </p>
        
      <p>In recent years...fast fashion brands have tried to change their images by pushing recycling programs that build their image...but much of this is marketing to get customers back in the door with a small discount.</p>
        
      <p>Even donating clothing doesn't solve the problem. Over 90% of all donated clothing still ends up being sold to textile retailers in developing countries where most clothing ends up in landfills.</p>
        
      <p>The only real solution is buying less clothing...from more reputable companies, and wearing them a little bit longer.</p>
        
      <p>Studies show that if Americans wore their clothing for just 9 more months and bought 1 used item instead of new...each of us would save around 6 tons of CO2 emissions each year. 
        
      That’s the equivalent of not driving for about a year and a half. All it takes is buying consciously..wearing longer...and occasionally looking for a used or fully recycled material item instead of a new one. </p>
