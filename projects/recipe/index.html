    <h1>Farfalle with Peas, Ham, & Cream Giangi's Kitchen</h1>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Farfalle with peas, ham, and cream. Quick and easy Italian dinner recipe that can be made in less than 20 minutes. This wonderful creamy pasta recipe is super simple to make and a great way to use any leftover ham that you may have.<br> I selected farfalle, or bow ties, not because they are my favorite pasta, but also because the sauce sits well in the little bow part of the pasta thus allowing you to get all the wonderful flavors. Penne or rigatoni are an alternate good choice. Whichever pasta you choose, make sure that it is tubular.<br> I enjoy cooking pasta al dente or to the bite. To make this dish a bit lighter you can substitute the heavy cream with whole milk.  Add more cheese as it will thicken the sauce a bit. You do not want a runny sauce but neither too thick. I do not recommend using almond milk or coconut milk either.<br> While the water comes to a boil you can start cooking the peas, ham, and cream sauce.  As they say in Italy, pasta does not wait for you, you wait for it.</p>
