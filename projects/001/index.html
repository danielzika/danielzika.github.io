        <p>Oriole Park at Camden Yards, often referred to as just Oriole Park or Camden Yards, is a Major
            League
            Baseball
            (MLB) ballpark located in Baltimore, Maryland. Home to the Baltimore Orioles, it is the first of
            the
            "retro"
            major league ballparks constructed during the 1990s and early 2000s. It was completed in 1992 to
            replace
            Memorial Stadium.</p>
        <p>The park is situated in downtown Baltimore, a few blocks west of the Inner Harbor in the Camden
            Yards
            Sports Complex.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Some notable games:</h2>
    <div class="row align-items-center">
        <ul>
            <li>September 6, 1995: Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive games
                played, and hit a
                home run during that game.
                <p>Attendees included President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al
                    Gore, Joe
                    DiMaggio, and Cal Ripken Sr.</p>
            </li>
            <li>May 17, 1996: Chris Hoiles hit a rare ultimate grand slam (walk off grand slam down by three
                runs),
                doing so in even more dramatic fashion with a full-count in the ninth inning to carry the
                Orioles to a
                14–13 victory over the Seattle Mariners.
                <p>In advance of Oriole Park's 25th anniversary, MLB
                    honored
                    the game as #3 most memorable in Oriole Park history.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>September 6, 1996: Eddie Murray hit his 500th career home run exactly one year after Cal
                    Ripken Jr.
                    broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive game streak.</p>
            </li>

            <li>October 15, 1997: The Cleveland Indians win Game 6 of the 1997 ALCS 1–0 in 11 innings to win
                the series
                4-2 and advance to the 1997 World Series.
                <p>To date, this is the closest the Orioles have been
                    to hosting
                    a World Series in Camden Yards, with the last one occurring 14 years before, when they were
                    still
                    playing at Memorial Stadium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>May 3, 1999: The Cuban national baseball team defeats the Orioles 12–6 in the second game of
                    a two-game

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>April 4, 2001: Hideo Nomo pitched the first no-hitter in the history of Camden Yards,

            </li>
            <li>October 4, 2001: Tim Raines Sr. played left field and Tim Raines Jr. played center field, in
                the 5–4
                loss to the Boston Red Sox becoming only the second father-son duo to play in the same game.
                <p>Ken Griffey
                    Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. were the only other father-son duo to do so (with the Seattle
                    Mariners, on
                    August 31, 1990).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>October 6, 2001: Cal Ripken, Jr.'s final MLB game. Former President Bill Clinton and MLB

            <li>
                <p>August 22, 2007: The Texas Rangers beat the Orioles 30–3 in game one of a doubleheader, the
                    highest
                    scoring game in 110 years.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>May 31, 2008: Manny Ramirez of the Boston Red Sox hits his 500th home run in a game against
                    the Orioles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>June 30, 2009: The Orioles rallied to score 10 runs against the Red Sox after facing a 10–1
                    deficit in
                    the 7th inning, breaking the franchise record for the largest comeback, and the Major League
                    Baseball
                    record for the largest comeback by a last place team over a first place team.</p>
            </li>
            <li>September 28, 2011: The Orioles defeated the Boston Red Sox in the final day of the season
                with a 4-3
                walk-off win. <p>The loss, coupled with the Tampa Bay Rays' 8–7 victory over the New York
                    Yankees at
                    Tropicana Field minutes later, eliminated the Red Sox from postseason contention. The Red
                    Sox became the
                    first team in baseball history to miss the postseason after leading by as many as nine games
                    for a
                    playoff spot entering the month of September.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>May 8, 2012: Josh Hamilton tied the Major League Baseball record for home runs in a game
                    with 4. He went
                    5 for 5 with four home runs and one double.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>October 3, 2014: The Orioles rallied with four runs in the 8th inning to top the Tigers 7–6
                    in Game 2 of
                    the American League Division Series.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>April 29, 2015: As a result of the 2015 Baltimore riots, the game against the White Sox was
                    closed to
                    the public, the first time that has ever happened in MLB history.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
